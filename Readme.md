Brain Tumor Prediction with Fun
Welcome to our brain tumor prediction project! This project is designed to help users predict whether or not an MRI scan shows the presence of a brain tumor. But we've added some fun to it too! As you make your prediction, our system will generate a unique and silly GIF that corresponds to your prediction.

How to Use
Go to our website.
Upload an MRI scan of a brain.
Wait for our algorithm to process the image and generate a prediction.
Enjoy the silly GIF that corresponds to your prediction!
How it Works
Our algorithm uses machine learning to analyze the MRI scan and determine if a brain tumor is present. We've trained the model using a large dataset of MRI scans with and without tumors. When you upload your scan, our model processes the image and generates a prediction.

To make the process more fun, we've integrated a GIF generator that creates a unique and silly GIF that corresponds to your prediction. Whether your scan shows the presence of a tumor or not, you'll get a funny GIF to enjoy.
