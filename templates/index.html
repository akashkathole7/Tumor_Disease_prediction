        <p class="BTD-desc" style="line-height: 2;">Hey there! Let's talk about brain tumors - one of the toughest illnesses in the medical world. When a tumor starts growing in the brain, it can be hard for doctors to figure out what's going on. That's why radiologists need to be super smart and efficient when analyzing the early stages of tumor growth.

            The best way to detect the grade of a brain tumor is through a stereotactic biopsy test. This is the gold standard in the medical world, but it can be a tricky and invasive process for brain tumor patients.
            
            Luckily, there are some non-invasive imaging techniques that can be used to diagnose brain tumors. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one such technique that has been used extensively.
            
            As a result, doctors are now working on developing systems that can detect and predict the grade of tumors based on MRI data. This is super important because it can help doctors get a better idea of what's going on in the brain without having to do an invasive procedure.
            
            So, while brain tumors can be a really tough disease, there are lots of smart people working on ways to diagnose and treat them more effectively.</p>

                        <p class="BTD-desc">they're the foundation of deep learning, a part of machine learning that's inspired by the structure of the human brain. These algorithms are super cool - they take in data, figure out patterns, and then use that knowledge to predict outputs for new sets of data.

                            NNs are made up of layers of neurons, which are like the core processing units of the network. It's like having a bunch of tiny brains all working together to solve a problem.
                            
                            When it comes to classifier models, there are two main categories: generative models based on hand-crafted features, and discriminative models. The goal of a classifier model is to figure out whether a given piece of data belongs to one group or another. Generative models are all about figuring out the probability that a piece of data belongs to a certain group, while discriminative models are more focused on figuring out the boundaries between different groups.
                            
                            CNNs are a type of neural network that are particularly good at identifying features in images. They can "look" at a brain scan and train themselves to recognize the patterns that indicate whether a tumor is present or not. This is super helpful for doctors who are trying to figure out whether a patient has a brain tumor or not.
                            
                            So, to sum up - neural networks are like tiny brains that can recognize patterns in data. CNNs are a specific type of neural network that are great at identifying features in images, which makes them super useful for diagnosing brain tumors. </p>
